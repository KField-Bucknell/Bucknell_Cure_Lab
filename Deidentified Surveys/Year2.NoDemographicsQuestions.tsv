Q1_pre	Informed Consent Bucknell University You are invited to participate in a research study to investigate the impact of Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (BIOL202) on student perceptions of science, themselves as scientists and their continuation to pursue an undergraduate degree in science. If you agree, at both the beginning and the end of the course, you will be presented with a brief survey that will present you with questions regarding your impressions of science and yourself as a scientist. These surveys are expected to last no longer than 15 minutes. Identifying information (name and email) will be collected to allow pairing of both pre- and post- course surveys, while also allowing us to determine your declared major either one year after the course or at the end of your second year at Bucknell (whichever is later) and degree conferred upon graduation. To preserve your confidentiality, analyzed results will only be presented in categories containing greater than 3 students. We believe that this study will help us understand how integrating research into an undergraduate biology curriculum impacts students’ trajectory and training as scientists. After collection, the data may also be used for future research studies or distributed to another researcher. Your participation is fully voluntary and you may discontinue your participation at any time. Whether or not you participate will not impact your grade in BIOL202, and your instructor will not see any data from this study until after final grades are submitted. To respect your confidentiality, all demographic information will be removed before section specific data is shared with individual instructors. Given the nature of the study, we do not anticipate any risk for you. The data collected will be stored digitally for analysis. If you have any questions or concerns about this study, you may contact the Principal Investigator, Moria Chambers, by phone at +1 6508623333 or email at moria.chambers@bucknell.edu. General questions or concerns about the rights of human subjects of research may be directed to the chair of the Institutional Review Board at Bucknell: Matthew H. Slater at matthew.slater@bucknell.edu . This study was approved by the Bucknell University IRB on August 6th, 2021 (Proposal #2122-010). By clicking ‘Agree’ below, I affirm that either I am 18 years of age or older or confirm that the principle investigator has documentation affirming the consent of my parents or legal guardian to participate in this research study:
