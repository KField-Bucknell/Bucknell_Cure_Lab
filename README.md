## Data Wrangling and Deidentification

`Survey Wrangling and Deidentification.Rmd` was used to clean up the
survey results, match the pre- and post- surveys by email address, and
then deidentify the results. The survey results were then saved in two
different versions, found in the folder `Deidentified Surveys`,
`NoDemographics.tsv` and `NoInstructor.tsv`. The deidentified
post-survey results were also saved separately, without removing the
students whose emails did not match the pre-survey, at `PostSurvey.tsv`.
